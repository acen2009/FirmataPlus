This is a ported Arduino firmware for 86Duino.

Visit the original MrYsLab/PyMata for details: https://github.com/MrYsLab/PyMata/raw/master/ArduinoSketch/libraries.zip

Use 86Duino IDE to upload this firmware to 86Duino boards, will communicate with python helper s2a_fm (https://github.com/MrYsLab/s2a_fm).

When the python helper (s2a_fm) executes successfully, open Scratch 2.0 and load the extension blocks of FirmataPLus, you can use those blocks to control 86Duino.
